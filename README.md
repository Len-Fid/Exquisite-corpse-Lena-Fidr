# When I couldn't sleep...
I was exhausted after a long day, but yet I couldn't fall asleep. I was curled up with my book on the sofa. Suddenly the silence of the night was interrupted by a strange noise...
<br>
I got up with a sigh, putting down my book.<br>
I bet it were those damned raccoons again, scavenging through my garbage bin.<br>
I opened the front door, ready to chase them away, and right there on my porch was a small red box, with a note attached to the side.<br>
